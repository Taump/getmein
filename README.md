# Counterstake demo in a browser app

This is a quick demo of [Counterstake SDK](https://github.com/byteball/counterstake-sdk) in a browser app. The demo is a web page built using React that allows the user to send some coins from Ethereum to Obyte through Counterstake Bridge](https://counterstake.org) and have them immediately converted to other coins via [Oswap.io](https://oswap.io).

Live websites: https://getmein.ooo (mainnet) and https://testnet.getmein.ooo (testnet).

## Run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/byteball/getmein
cd getmein
yarn
yarn start
```
